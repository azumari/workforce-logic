# Project Workforce (Logic) 
> Reserved for additional information or tagline

Project Workforce is a collaboration project that combines three smaller projects into one large
cohesive application. 

Project Felice is the heart of the project and focuses primarily upon the base 'On Boarding' 
process at Revature LLC. The base 'On Boarding' process' primary purpose is to record and manage
all new associates that are just joining Revature or even old associates that are returning or
still presently a part of Revature. Felice communicates this data to both Project Charlie and
Project Grace.

Project Grace is the next step within the 'On Boarding' process and focuses upon the housing
aspect. Grace allows the Housing Manager to manage the various hotels and apartment complexes that
Revature has a contract with as well as managing the associates assigned to them. This will in
turn provide a greater ease of use for the Housing Managers as they perform their necessary tasks.

Project Charlie is the final piece that allows associates to setup a 'Ride Share' amongst each
other. Associates can log into the application to either offer a ride that others can request to
join or seek out nearby ride offers that are presently available.

This particular aspect of Workforce focuses on the Business Logic Layer (BLL) of the three 
collaborative projects.
