# Project Workforce (Logic) 
> Reserved for additional information or tagline

Project Workforce is an enterprise web application handling the onboarding, housing, and 
transportation of Revature associates. 

Project Felice provides a portal for adding incoming associates to the system and managing 
records related to existing associates (the "onboarding" process).

Project Grace manages associates' placement into hotels and apartment complexes. An HR user 
may view existing room assignments and organize incoming associates' assignments by batch.  

Project Charlie is a rideshare application for Revature associates. Users may offer or request 
rides to or from defined meetup locations in the Reston and Herndon areas, in addition to 
browsing previous ride or request postings. 

This code forms the Logic layer of the application. We perform validation and user authentication  
and connect the Data layer's WCF SOAP service to the user interface with a WebApi REST service.
