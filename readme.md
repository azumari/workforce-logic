# Project Workforce (Logic) 
> Reserved for additional information or tagline

Project Workforce is an enterprise web application handling the onboarding, housing, and 
transportation of Revature associates. 

Project Felice focuses primarily upon the onboarding process 
at Revature LLC. It provides a portal for adding incoming associates to the system and managing 
records related to existing associates.

Project Grace allows management of the associates' housing. An HR user may view existing room 
assignments and organize incoming associates' assignments by batch. 
group incoming batches together. 

Project Charlie is a rideshare application for Revature associates. Users may offer or request 
rides to or from defined meetup locations in the Reston and Herndon areas, in addition to 
browsing previous ride or request postings. 

This code forms the Logic layer of the application. We perform validation and user authentication  
and connect the Data layer's WCF SOAP service to the user interface with a WebApi REST service.
